			<h1>
				About this Application
			</h1>
			This sample application was built by Jim McCurdy
			(<a href="mailto:Jim.McCurdy@webtellect.com">Jim.McCurdy@webtellect.com</a>).
			<br/>
			<br />
			It was developed as a WPF/Silverlight skills exercise for
			<a href="http://possibleworldwide.com">Possible Worldwide</a>. I created this application 
			specifically for this purpose, and drew upon the library of classes that I have 
			developed over the last few years.  I can vouch for the fact that, to the best of my knowledge, 
			I have developed all of the code contained in this project.<br />
			<br />
			The following concepts are being demonstrated in this application.
			<h2>
				MVVM:
			</h2>
			<div>
			All classes containing the Views, ViewModels, and Models are clearly separated in the project.  
			The ViewModels and Models have no knowledge of the Views.
			The only code-behind in the Views are the simple MEF properties that wire them up the ViewModels 
			or their sub-Views.
			Had I used an MVVM framework (Prism, Caliburn, MVVM Light, Jounce/MEF, etc.), I could have avoided
			these few additional properties, but there is something very enticing about the simplicity of 
			MVVM using MEF and a good ViewModelBase class.
			</div>
			<h2>
				UI Composition:
			</h2>
			<div>
			MEF was used as a tool to compose and layout the application View. I love the simplicity of it, 
			even over WPF Regions.  Inside the main ShellView, there are 3 top level Views; the top 
			HeaderView, the left NavigationView, 
			and the main ActiveContentView.  The ActiveContentView is further sub-divided into 5 views that 
			are selectable by the Buttons in the NavigationView.
			</div>
			<h2>
				Commands:
			</h2>
			<div>
				Commanding was used by the buttons in the NavigationView to wire them up to actions in the 
				MainViewModel.<br />
			</div>
			<h2>
				Data Binding:
			</h2>
			<div>
				Data binding was used to wire the DataGrids for Riders, Donors, and Donations to their 
				respective ViewModels, and ultimately on to the sample Model data.
				A CSV reader was used to load the sample Model data, and a bit of LINQ was used to show how 
				the data can be filtered.<br />
			</div>
			<h2>
				Custom Controls:
			</h2>
			<div>
				Several custom controls were developed and used in the app.  First, a few simple XAML-less 
				derived controls were added,
				like my StretchPanel (a personal favorite), and the simple Spacer control.  Secondly a
				templated control like 
				RichTextBlock was based on RichTextBox.  RichTextBlock serves as a basis for my HtlmTextBlock 
				control.  HtlmTextBlock is used for 
				this AboutView and on the WelcomeView.  Right click the text content on the page to see 
				evidence of 
				one other custom control: a ContextMenuText control.<br />
			</div>
			<h2>
				Value Converters:
			</h2>
			<div>
				I included several value converters in the project, but one of them is used to convert the 
				boolean state properties in the MainViewModel to the Visibility property of their 
				corresponding Views.  This ValueIsNullFalseZeroEmpty converter is a multi-purpose 
				converter that handles several different value types and target types.<br />
			</div>
			<h2>
				Behaviors:
			</h2>
			<div>
				As a bonus, I included my MouseWheelBehavior in the project but did have an opportunity to use it in the 
				application.  It works well with Silverlight 3 apps as well as Silverlight 4 TreeViews and Sliders.<br />
			</div>
			<br/>
			Thanks for your consideration.
