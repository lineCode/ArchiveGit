				Welcome to the Happy Face Road Race!
			</h1>
			The Happy Face Road Race raises money for life-saving cancer research and treatment at the
			<span>Regional Cancer Institute</span>
			through an annual bike-a-thon that crosses the state.
			<br />
			<br />
			Since its founding 
			in 1980, the HFRR has successfully melded support from committed cyclists, volunteers, corporate 
			sponsors and individual contributors. All are essential to the HFRR's goal and model: to attain 
			maximum fundraising efficiency while increasing its annual gift.
			<br />
			<br />
			Our hope and aspiration is to 
			provide the doctors and researchers the necessary resources to discover cures for all 
			cancers.<br/>
