				Privacy Policy
			</h1>
			At YinYangMoney, we believe privacy is important.  Here's where we stand.
			Access, use, and preservation of personal information by YinYangMoney should
			only occur as a means to make YinYangMoney a great experience for you.  The
			disclosure of personal information should never occur without your explicit consent.
			Any question?  <a href="#Feedback">Contact Us!</a><br />
			<h2>
				Does YinYangMoney use cookies?
			</h2>
			Yes, YinYangMoney sets a cookie to simply streamline the sign in process.
			But we do not use cookies to track your web surfing.<br />
			<h2>
				Does YinYangMoney save email addresses?
			</h2>
			YinYangMoney will only save your personal email so we can keep you up to date.
			We don't share your name or email address, and we don't even ask for your postal address,
			social security number, or financial account numbers.<br />
			<h2>
				Will any of my personal information be shared with 3rd parties?
			</h2>
			No. If it were up to us, spammers would be tarred and feathered.
			Also, if YinYangMoney becomes involved in a merger, acquisition,
			or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice
			before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.<br />
			<h2>
				Will this privacy policy change?
			</h2>
			As YinYangMoney evolves, this privacy policy is likely to evolve with it.
			We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of our privacy policy in an archive for your review. We will continue to always keep our users apprised of updates.<br />
			<br />
			We also adhere to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.
			For more information about the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe harbor principles,
			see the Department of Commerce's web site.<br />
