			<h2 style="color:Green">
				Troubleshooting:
			</h2>
			<h2>
				What are the system requirements for running YinYangMoney?
			</h2>
			At minimum we recommend that you have Microsoft Windows XP/Vista, Mac OS X or Linux, with a 
			1GHz processor or better, and at least 512 MB of RAM. You will also need a web browser such as 
			Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher, Firefox 2.0 or higher, or Safari 2 or higher.<br />
			<h2>
				Why did I need to download Silverlight to run YinYangMoney?
			</h2>
			YinYangMoney itself is a lightweight and 'download-less' experience. But it does require Silverlight
			to be installed in order to have the rich, full-featured experience of software application within 
			a browser.<br />
			<h2>
				Will YinYangMoney affect my computer's performance?
			</h2>
			No, YinYangMoney was built with performance in mind and we consider its speed one of its many
			advantages over other software solutions. Because it runs in a web browser, you should be able
			to run YinYangMoney in much the same way that you would any other web app.<br />
			<h2>
				What do I do if YinYangMoney does not load, or only loads the title bar?
			</h2>
			This behavior means that the local settings and configurations on your computer or network are 
			preventing YinYangMoney from working properly.<br />
			<br />
			1. First, it is amazing how many issues can be resolved with refreshing or reloading YinYangMoney. 
			Click the refresh button in your browser or press Ctrl+F5 for a forced, unconditional refresh.<br />
			<br />
			2. Try installing or re-installing the latest version of Silverlight here: 
			<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/resources/install.aspx" target="_blank">Download Silverlight.</a><br />
			<br />
			3. Next, make sure your browser settings for JavaScript and secure content are set as follows:<br />
			<br />
			<span style="color:Goldenrod; font-weight:bold;">In Internet Explorer for Windows</span>, 
			select Tools->Internet Options:<br />
			a) On the second tab, Security, click the Default Level button.<br />
			b) Next, click on Trusted Sites in the upper scroll window, and then click the Sites button below it. 
			Uncheck 'Require Sever Verification https...' at the bottom, then enter '*.YinYangMoney.com,' then 
			click the Add button, then click the Close button.<br />
			c) On the third tab, Privacy, move the slider to Medium.<br />
			d) On the fifth tab, Connections, click the LAN Settings button. Click the checkbox for 'Automatically 
			detect settings' if it isn't already and uncheck the checkbox for 'Use a proxy server for your LAN' 
			if it is selected. Click OK.<br />
			e) On the last tab, Advanced, click the Restore Defaults button (this is called the Restore Advanced 
			Settings button in IE7). Click OK at the bottom of the Internet Options box.<br />
			<br />
			<span style="color:Goldenrod; font-weight:bold;">In Safari for Mac OSX</span>, 
			select Safari->Preferences->Security Tab. Under Web Content check every option except for 
			'Block pop ups.'<br />
			<br />
			<span style="color:Goldenrod; font-weight:bold;">If you use Firefox</span>, 
			make sure to disable add-ons (extensions) like Adblock, Flashblock, or NoScript.<br />
			<br />
			Internet Explorer for Windows, Firefox for Windows, Firefox for Mac OS X, Safari for Mac OS X or 
			Firefox for Linux are our only supported browsers.<br />
			<br />
			4. If you are using a personal Internet firewall or anti-virus program, it could be blocking the 
			Silverlight portions of the YinYangMoney site. Try allowing access to http://YinYangMoney.com and 
			https://YinYangMoney.com within those programs and then try visiting YinYangMoney again. If still 
			no results, try disabling such programs entirely as a test. If that solves the issue, contact 
			customer support for your security software to discuss allowing Silverlight content when browsing 
			the internet.<br />
			<br />
			5. Another possibility is that your system time/date is incorrect, which can cause issues with 
			YinYangMoney's security certificates. Make sure to set your system clock to the current date and time.<br />
			<br />
			6. Finally, you should try restarting your browser (and then if issue persists, try rebooting your 
			computer).<br />
			<br />
			If none of the above steps allow the YinYangMoney to run properly, please hit the Feedback button 
			in the upper right corner of your screen.<br />
			<h2>
				How do I delete my account?
			</h2>
			You can delete your account now by clicking the Home tab, then 
			<a href="/app/Home/My_Account">My Account.</a>
			There is a button there to delete your account. Please note, when you do it, it will log
			you out and close any document you currently have open.<br />
			<h2>
				Which version of YinYangMoney am I using?
			</h2>
			This is YinYangMoney version: 1.0<br />
