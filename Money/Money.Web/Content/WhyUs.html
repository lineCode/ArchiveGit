				Why Us?
			</h1>
			Here are the top reasons why you should use YinYangMoney to build a personal online financial plan.<br/>
			<h2>
				1. YinYangMoney is easy.
			</h2>
			If you have ever used other financial planning and budgeting software, or tried to plan for the future 
			using spreadsheets, you know how frustrating it can be to gather all the data the software requires.  
			YinYangMoney will let you build a simple profile, so it can start your plan with intelligent estimates 
			of your income and spending already in place.  It is so easy that you will actually use it.<br/>
			<h2>
				2. YinYangMoney is fast.
			</h2>
			Examine a lifetime of income and spending by “sliding” through the months and years ahead to examine 
			your financial life.  Drag and drop your goals and aspirations, and your plan stays up to date.<br/>
			<h2>
				3. YinYangMoney is fun.
			</h2>
			Just because you are making a serious plan regarding yourself and your family's future, doesn't mean 
			it has to be tedious, boring and stressful.  With YinYangMoney, you will find yourself playing 
			“what if” games with your future goals and get instant results.<br/>
			<h2>
				4. YinYangMoney is secure.
			</h2>
			We've done everything possible to ensure the safe keeping of your data and the data you collect.  
			Your plan is stored on your own computer, and backed up on our servers only if you request it.  
			You'll be anonymous with YinYangMoney; we don't share your name or email address, and we don't 
			even ask for your postal address, social security number, or financial account numbers.  You can 
			always count on us to be unbiased.<br/>
			<h2>
				5. YinYangMoney is portable.
			</h2>
			Wherever you have an Internet connection, you have access to YinYangMoney.  And any plans you 
			have allowed us to backup on our servers are available for review, modification, and printing.  
			YinYangMoney is available 24/7.<br/>
			<h2>
				6. YinYangMoney helps you understand.
			</h2>
			Many budgeting applications, calculators, and financial advisors make simplifying assumptions 
			about your monthly spending because they are not well suited to getting down to the details.  
			YinYangMoney has wizards to expand your simple profile into a detailed plan that automatically 
			fills in spending categories that the other guys ignore.  You will see how your money comes and 
			goes over a lifetime, which will empower you to live a more meaningful life.<br/>
			<h2>
				7. YinYangMoney is focused.
			</h2>
			Many desktop applications that offer budgeting and planning tools are often bloated with features, 
			or are more concerned with balancing your checkbook and paying your bills.  YinYangMoney is simply 
			focused on helping you plot the future, and helping you understand the choices that will maximize 
			your standard of living over a lifetime.<br/>
			<h2>
				8. YinYangMoney gives you control over your money.
			</h2>
			YinYangMoney lets you see the flow of money in your life, and gives you the confidence to make 
			financial decisions like no other set of software tools.<br/>
			<h2>
				9. YinYangMoney is connects you to a community
			</h2>
			Developing a financial plan is enhanced by when you can compare your role in the world with others.  
			YinYangMoney connects you to our other users to give and receive guidance.  It taps into the collective 
			intelligence of our users, so you will understand when you are spending more than others, or how 
			geography can affect pricing and the cost of living.<br/>
			<h2>
				10. YinYangMoney is inexpensive.
			</h2>
			If you have ever user a financial advisor to setup a plan, you know that it can cost hundreds or 
			thousands of dollars.  And once you build a plan with that advisor, you will sometimes feel pressured 
			to make investments that your advisor makes commissions from.  YinYangMoney give you the ability to 
			build an unbiased plan; a Basic Plan for Free, and a Premium Plan for less than 25 dollars a year!  
			That's less than the cost of most desktop software, and cheaper than a couple of pizzas!  
			And after creating your YinYangMoney account, you can leave at anytime without any questions asked.  
			Why not try it out when it costs so little to be the family hero?<br/>
