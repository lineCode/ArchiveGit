				Welcome to McPivot
				Baseball
			</h1>
			The easiest way to visualize baseball data and card images.<br/>
			<h2>
				How McPivot works:
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>McPivot utilizes Microsoft's Silverlight, PivotViewer, and DeepZoom technologies to present historical baseball data in a new and highly visual fashion.</li>
				<li>At the heart of McPivot is a large data collection, and the thousands of DeepZoom images that give the data a face.&#160; Therefore it may take a minute or two for the collection to appear.&#160; Be patient.&#160; If you have a low memory or low performing computer, you may want to try McPivot again when you have access to a beefier machine.</li>
				<li>When you are ready to access the data collection, click the Viewer tab above, or <a href="/app/Viewer/View">access the Viewer here</a>.</li>
				<li>If you have questions or comments, please don't be shy about passing along your  <a href="#Feedback">Feedback</a>.</li>
				<li>Don&#39;t forget to register an account so we can keep you up to date with information about new features and collections.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Tips for browsing data collections in the Viewer tab:
			</h2>
			<span>On the player images:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out of any collection</li>
				<li>Click a player to select it, zoom into it, show “Info” to the right, and hide the “Filter” panel to the left</li>
				<li>Click a player a 2nd time to unselect it, un-zoom back to the previous view, hide the “Info” panel, and show “Filter” panel again</li>
			</ul>
			<span>On the top bar:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Use the zoom slider to adjust magnify and back away manually</li>
				<li>Alternate between the “Graph” view and “Grid” view</li>
				<li>Use the “Sort” drop down list to organize the way the data is displayed for the “Graph” view</li>
			</ul>
			<span>On the left hand “Filter” panel:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Select only the data you want to view</li>
				<li>Use the “Search...” box to find any data, about any player</li>
				<li>Click any checkbox to toggle the data fields on and off, but also click the name to the right of the checkbox to automatically unselect all others fields first</li>
				<li>Use the “Clear All” button at the top to reset and view all of the data</li>
			</ul>
			<span>On the right hand “Info” panel:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>View the selected player’s info</li>
				<li>Click any links provided to “Filter” on that data field</li>
			</ul>
			<span>Please note that the Builder tab is coming soon.&#160; We are currently working on the Builder to allow you to create custom data collections.</span>
