				<li><a href="http://facetofacesoftware.com">Jim McCurdy</a> is the developer of the McPivot software and website, and had the vision to marry the latest technologies of Silverlight, PivotViewer, and DeepZoom with the traditional relational database.&#160; Jim is pioneering the visualization of large, interactive, just-in-time data collections.</li>
				<li>Thanks to Joe McAnally at the <a href="http://www.guitar9.com/bccm.html">Baseball Card Cyber Museum</a>, and Bill at the <a href="http://baseballsimulator.com/blog/category/baseballcards/">Baseball Simulator</a>, for providing the great collection of source images for this application. </li>
				<li>Thanks to <a href="http://baseball1.com">Sean Lahman</a> and his team of researchers for compiling the data sets that chronicle baseball statistics back to 1871.&#160; Sean pioneered the effort to make baseball statistics freely available to the general public.</li>
				<li>Thanks <b>to Sean Forman, who </b>created and maintains <a href="http://baseball-reference.com">Baseball-Reference.com</a>. Recognized as the
					premier online reference source, Forman's site provides an outstanding
					interface to the raw data. Forman has spearheaded
					the effort to provide standards that enable several different baseball
					databases to be used together.</li>
				<li>Since 2001, the two Seans have led a group of researchers
					who volunteered to maintain and update the database, first 
					by taking the raw data and creating a relational database, and later
					by extending the database to make it more accessible to researchers. Five of those
					researchers have made substantial contributions to version 5.0 of this
					database. Listed alphabetically, they are: <b>Derek Adair, Mike Crain, Kevin Johnson, Tom Tango, and Paul Wendt</b>. These folks did most
					of the heavy lifting, and are largely responsible for the improvements
					made to the current release.</li>
				<li>Much of the raw data contained in this database comes from the work of <b>Pete Palmer</b>, the legendary statistician, who has edited most of the baseball encyclopedias published since 1974. He is solely responsible for bringing the batting, pitching, and fielding data out of the dark ages and into the computer era.&#160; Without him, none of this would be possible.&#160; For more on Pete's work, please read <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:n3Zpfkiyic0J:sabr.org/cmsfiles/PalmerDatabaseHistory.pdf+%22palmerdatabasehistory.pdf%22&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiwViAe6Lc5GvihoCOg_bLBStPE9QllGWJ6ECa5SiayjyvkyQBDXitNIWG3iKODm1hWADtmodoF2zAapVhFfg3NmoEdUh_fvsmiSV4-VTX4aebICyucwOfaTaGlbdKfYwq_ttpB&sig=AHIEtbTCB1ID0a3bYW_oz49TYQE1Dh4uYg&pli=1">his own account</a>.</li>
				<li>Others who made important contributions to the database include: <b>Clifford Blau,
					Bill Burgess, Clem Comly, Jeff Burk, Randy Cox, Mitch Dickerman,
					Paul DuBois, Mike Emeigh, F.X. Flinn, Bill Hickman, Jerry Hoffman,
					Dan Holmes, Micke Hovmoller, Peter Kreutzer, Danile Levine,
					Bruce Macleod, Ken Matinale, Michael Mavrogiannis, Rod Nelson,
					Cliff Otto, Alberto Perdomo, Dave Quinn, Tom Ruane, Theron Skyles,
					Michael Westbay, and Rob Wood</b>.</li>
				<li>Many other people have made significant contributions to the database
					over the years.&#160; The contribution of <b>Tom Ruane</b>'s effort to the overall
					quality of the underlying data has been tremendous. His creation at
					<a href="http://www.retrosheet.org">Retrosheet.org</a> integrates the yearly data with the day-by-day data,
					creating a reference source of startling depth. It is unlikely than
					any individual has contributed as much to the field of baseball
					research in the past five years as Ruane has.</li>
				<li><b>Sean Holtz</b> helped with a major database overhaul and redesign before the
					2000 season. <b>Keith Woolner</b> was instrumental in helping turn
					a huge collection of stats into a relational database in the mid-1990s.&#160;
					<b>Clifford Otto &amp; Ted Nye</b> also helped provide guidance to the early
					versions. Lee Sinnis, <b>John Northey &amp; Erik Greenwood</b> helped supply key
					pieces of data. Many others have written in with corrections and
					suggestions that made each subsequent version even better than what
					preceded it.</li>
				<li>The work of the SABR Baseball Records Committee, led by <b>Lyle Spatz</b>
					has been invaluable.&#160; So has the work of <b>Bill Carle</b> and the SABR
					Biographical Committee. <b>David Vincent</b>, keeper of the Home Run Log and
					other bits of hard to find info, has always been helpful. The recent
					addition of colleges to player bios is the result of much research by
					members of SABR's Collegiate Baseball committee.&#160;
					Salary data has been supplied by <b>Doug Pappas</b>, who passed away during
					the summer of 2004. He was the leading authority on many subjects,
					most significantly the financial history of Major League Baseball.&#160;
					We are grateful that he allowed us to include some of the data he
					has compiled.&#160; His work will be continued by the SABR Business of
					Baseball committee.</li>
				<li>Thanks is also due to the staff at the National Baseball Library
					in Cooperstown who have been so helpful -- <b>Tim Wiles, Jim Gates,
					Bruce Markusen</b>, and the rest of the staff.&#160; <b>Dan Holmes</b> has been
					a great liaison between the folks who work on this database and
					the folks at the Hall of Fame.</li>
				<li>A special debt of gratitude is owed to  <b>Dave Smith</b> and the folks at Retrosheet. There is no other group working so hard to compile and share baseball data.&#160; The <a href="http://www.retrosheet.org">Retrosheet</a> website will give
					you a taste of the wealth of information Dave and the gang have collected.</li>
				<li>Thanks to all contributors great and small. What you have created is
					a wonderful thing.<br />
