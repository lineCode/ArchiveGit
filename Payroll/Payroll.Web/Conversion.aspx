			Considerations When Converting To New Payroll Software • Timing — When planning the conversion 
			to a new payroll software solution, timing is important. Most companies find it easiest to make 
			the transition at certain times during the year, such as immediately after a quarter-end, or 
			more commonly, after year-end. Starting with a new system at the beginning of a year is 
			particularly convenient because it allows you to simply import historical data from the previous 
			year or two via a link product, and start the new year with zero balances in the system. 
			Switching software at the beginning of a quarter is another option. You’ll start fresh with a 
			new quarter, but will still have to convert calendar year information pertaining to employee 
			taxes, earnings, and deductions. Converting this information incorrectly can cause problems - 
			it could affect W-2 reporting, earnings and deductions, and especially employer tax liability 
			data. It’s also very important to make sure that all quarter end dates are correct when 
			implementing the new system, or quarter end reporting could be inaccurate. To avoid these issues 
			altogether, and to help the implementation run as smoothly as possible, it’s usually recommended 
			that companies switch at a quarter-end or year-end. This isn’t a necessity, however. If it makes 
			sense for your company to implement a new payroll solution at a different time, just make sure 
			to ask your vendor if there are any special considerations that need to be kept in mind.
			 • Resources — Consider who will be performing the installation and setup of the new payroll 
			 system. Does the vendor offer implementation and consulting services? Will you need to choose 
			 a reseller? Or will you be required to set the system up on your own? If any internal resources 
			 will be required during the implementation, it’s important to plan for this. • Data transfer 
			 and conversion — Consider how data from the existing system will be entered into the new system. 
			 Will the data need to be manually entered, or can it be imported? It’s especially convenient if 
			 the vendor offers an easily-customizable link to transfer data from one system to another. This 
			 often involves setting up “translation tables” in the link template that equate fields in the 
			 old system to fields in the new system. Once the data is transferred, it’s necessary to verify 
			 that all information is correct. This can be done by running reports from both systems and 
			 comparing the results. 11 • Side-by-side processing — After the implementation of the new system 
			 is complete, most companies check the accuracy of the new system by running both the old and 
			 new payroll systems parallel for a period of time. This period is up to the discretion of the 
			 company – it can be one payroll run, a month, or three months. Again, accuracy of data can be 
			 determined by running the appropriate reports. In particular, crossreferencing the numbers on 
			 payroll history, check history, and earnings, deductions, and tax reports is a good way to 
			 determine if everything is set up correctly in the new system. Discrepancies can often be traced 
			 back to outdated tax tables in the old system, inaccurate translation tables, or slightly 
			 different pay groups.
