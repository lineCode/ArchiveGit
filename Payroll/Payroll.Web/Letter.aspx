		<h1>Letter from the founder</h1>
		<p class="indent">
		As the owner of a startup, or a small to medium-sized business, you need to stay on top of your company's 
		core activities if you want to beat out your competition. &nbsp;&#9632;&nbsp; That's why you don't want to be 
		burdened by administrative tasks that take you away from what's important. &nbsp;&#9632;&nbsp; But computing and 
		collecting payroll taxes, filing IRS and state tax forms, and hand writing payroll checks is exactly 
		the kind of 
		business activity that can put a drain your company's limited resources.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		I faced these same payroll burdens myself and, as a startup, began doing payroll processing 
		by hand. &nbsp;&#9632;&nbsp; Later on, when I looked for solutions to the problem, I couldn't 
		bring myself to add the expense of a pricey out-sourcing firm, and didn't have enough employees to justify 
		a bookeeper. &nbsp;&#9632;&nbsp; But once I discovered 
		that I could use a high quality "do-it-yourself" online service, and not break the bank doing it, 
		I knew that I had found a great solution. &nbsp;&#9632;&nbsp; It gave me the assurance that my 
		payroll would always be accurate, and gave me back the time to focus on my business.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">

		highly discounted price. &nbsp;&#9632;&nbsp; This is the same online application used by more than

		a way to offer you the same high-quality do-it-yourself service, at the lowest possible wholesale price.

		to 150 employees, or simply a household employer, we think DiscountPayroll.net will be the best fit for you.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">

		and the convenience that makes this web application one of the best online payroll products in the
