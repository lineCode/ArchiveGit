    (b) enforce these Terms of Use; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third 
    parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 3Guppies, its users, or the public.</p>

    through the Services by 3Guppies or by any vendor or service provider. You will also pay any 
    applicable taxes relating to use of the Services through your account. At its sole discretion, 
    3Guppies reserves the right at any time to offer subscriptions to the Services at a discount

    <h4><em>CONTENT</em></h4>
    <p>The Site and the Services may allow you and other third parties to post data, music, pictures, 
    videos, digital files, text, code, messages, opinions, advice, statements, reviews, comments,

    Content, whether publicly posted on or privately transmitted via the Site or the Services, is the sole 
    responsibility of the person from whom the User-Generated Content originated and not of 3Guppies, 
    or its shareholders, directors, officers, or employees.  3Guppies may review and delete any 
    User-Generated Content, in whole or in part, that in the sole judgment of 3Guppies violates these

    parties. The Site and the Services also include music tones, voice tones and sound fx, premium 
    graphics/screensavers, premium games, and other content that you can download (collectively, 
    "<strong>Premium &amp; Unlimited Content</strong>"). There may be a fee associated with Premium &amp; Unlimited Content, 
    and you agree to pay 3Guppies all charges for the Premium &amp; Unlimited Content as listed in your order 
    confirmation. 3Guppies does not give refunds for Premium &amp; Unlimited Content. Nonetheless, under no

    partners, or affiliates be held liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on User-Generated 
    Content or Premium &amp; Unlimited Content (collectively, "<strong>Content</strong>") obtained through the Site or the 
    Services.  It is your responsibility to evaluate the Content available through the Services or the Site.  
    Although User-Generated Content will not be pre-screened, we may review it at our discretion and we 
    reserve the right to refuse or delete any Content. Be aware that while the Services are intended for general 
    audiences, because 3Guppies's website contains User-Generated Content, objectionable material may 
    appear on the Site or the Services from time to time. Individuals who are under the age of 18 or who are 
    otherwise prohibited by law to access such content may not access, view or download such content.</p>
    
    <h4><em>LICENSES</em></h4>
    <p>By posting User-Generated Content you hereby grant (or warrant that the owner of the User-Generated 
    Content grants) us and each user of the Site or the Services a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully

    with such dealings, are solely between you and such user, advertiser, or partner.  You agree that we are not responsible 
    or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of 
    such advertisers or partners on the Site or the Services.</p>
    
    <h4><em>GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION</em></h4>
    <p>These Terms of Use are governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Washington, as such laws are applied to 
    agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Washington between Washington residents.  Any controversy 
    or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use, the Services, the Products, or the Site will be settled by binding 
    arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Any such 
    controversy or claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis, and will not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim 
    or controversy of any other party.  The arbitration will be conducted in King County, Washington, and judgment on the 
    arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The award of the arbitrator will be final and 
    binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by Washington law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
    either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to 
    protect the party’s rights or property pending the completion of arbitration.  By using the Site or the Services, you consent 
    and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington.</p>
    
    <h4><em>RELEASE</em></h4>
    <p>In the event that you have a dispute with one or more users of the Site or the Services, you release 3Guppies and its 
    stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and affiliatesfrom claims, demands, and 
    damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed 
    and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.  If you are a California resident, you waive 
    California Civil Code §1542, which says:  "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know 
    or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected 
    his settlement with the debtor."</p>
    
    <h4><em>GENERAL</em></h4>
    <p>3Guppies’s failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive its ability to act with respect to that circumstance 
    or similar circumstances.  By using the Site or the Services, you consent to receiving electronic communications from 3Guppies.  
    These communications will include notices about your account and information concerning or related to the Services.  
    You agree that any notice, agreements, disclosure, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy 
    any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.  3Guppies is excused for any 
    failure to perform to the extent that its performance is prevented by any reason outside of its control.  These Terms of Use, 
    together with our Privacy Policy, comprise the entire agreement between you and 3Guppies and supersede all prior agreements 
    between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein. Any provision of these Terms of Use which is determined by 
    an authorized arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be severable from these 
    Terms of Use in that jurisdiction without in any way invalidating the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use. The unenforceability 
    of any provision in a given jurisdiction will not make that provision unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.</p>
