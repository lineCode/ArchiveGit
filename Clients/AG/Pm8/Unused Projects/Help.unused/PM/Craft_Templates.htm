   Using Craft Templates</H2>
  <P>
   With PrintMaster's new Craft Corner projects, you can make 3D crafts 
   like gift bags, fold-up doll houses, chess sets, baskets, paper 
   airplanes, spaceships-and then customize them to fit your needs. 
   There are even templates for creating miniature towns and farms!</P>
  <P>
   Create the Craft Corner projects as you would any other project and 
   print them on your color printer. The directions for cutting, 
   folding, and pasting the Craft Corner project will be printed 
   directly on the project page. </P>
