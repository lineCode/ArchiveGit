   ELEMENTS: Setting Position and Size</H6>
  <P>
   When you need to precisely specify the Size or Position of an element 
   in your project, click the <B>More...</B> command in the <B>Arrange 
   &gt; Position</B> submenu, the popup menu, or the status bar popup.</P>
  <P>
   The dialog box that appears lets you select from several pre-assigned 
   measurements and percentages, or you can enter your own value. The <B>Preview</B> 
   displayed at the right of the box shows what effect your changes will have.</P>
  <P>
   This feature could be helpful if you wanted to use preprinted 
   letterhead containing a design or logo, or to fit a graphic on a 
   specific size label, etc.
