  <P>
   PrintMaster automatically installs a small application that monitors 
   your address book and notifies you of any birthday, anniversary or 
   other event ahead of time - so you won&#146;t miss another important date.</P>

   The Event reminder application contains some preset options, and 
   guides you step-by-step in selecting the types of events to notify 
   you about.</P>

   To view the Event Reminder settings, or set up your own reminders, 
   click the <B>Event Reminder...</B> command in the <B>Tools</B> menu
