   Online Art Gallery</H5>
  <P>
   PrintMaster's Online Art Gallery is the simple way to obtain 
   additional pictures for your projects without having to switch 
   CD-ROMs. Just by selecting the Online Art Gallery images in the Art 
   Gallery, PrintMaster will connect to the Internet, download the 
   image, and place it in your project.</P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">To add an Online Art Gallery 
   picture to your project and Online Collection:</SPAN></P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Double-click a preview in the Art Gallery labeled 'Online Art Gallery 
    Collection.' Only the preview is provided in your copy of 
    PrintMaster. You will have to download the actual picture file from 
    the Online Art Gallery to use it in your project or store it in the 
    Online Collection.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If this is the first time you have connected to the Online Art 
    Gallery, you will be asked to create a new account. Insert a Name, 
    Password, and Email Address in the dialog boxes. Please write down 
    the information you provided so you will have it in case you need it 
    (e.g. you get a new computer and want to re-establish your account.)</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    If you are already connected to the Internet (for example, if you 
    already launched your online service or have a direct connection to 
    the Internet), PrintMaster will access the picture you selected and 
    download it into your Online Collection. If you are not connected to 
    the Internet, PrintMaster will launch your Internet service first, 
    then download the picture file.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    After the picture file has been downloaded, you will notice the 
    preview in the Art Gallery no longer says 'Online Art Gallery'. That 
    means the picture file is now copied into your project and onto your 
    hard drive in the Online Collection. You will not have to download it 
    again to use the picture in your projects.
