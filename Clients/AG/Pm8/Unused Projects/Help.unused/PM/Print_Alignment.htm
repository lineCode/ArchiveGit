   Print Alignment</H6>
  <P>
   If your projects seem to print out of alignment, click the <B>Print Alignment</B> 
   command in the <B>File</B> menu. You print a test page, then use a 
   ruler to measure the distance to the figure in the middle of the test 
   page. After typing in the measurements, PrintMaster automatically 
   adjusts for any discrepancies in the alignment of your printer.
