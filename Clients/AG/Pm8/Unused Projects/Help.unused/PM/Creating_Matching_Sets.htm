   Creating Matching Sets</H2>
  <P>
   With Matching Sets, you can create a look for your business, 
   organization, or event effortlessly. A matching set might include 
   letterhead, business cards, brochures, newsletters, and envelopes for 
   your business.</P>
  <P>
   Matching sets are projects that look similar. These projects use the 
   same colors, follow the same theme, or share the same images. They 
   look like they belong together. The PrintMaster Project Gallery 
   contains many ready-made projects that combine to form matching sets. 
   Use these projects as the starting point for creating your own 
   matching sets, or create them on your own.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Hint</SPAN>: Save matching sets 
   projects together so they can share the same images &#150; when you 
   edit the image, it will transfer the changes to all the projects.
