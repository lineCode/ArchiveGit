   The workspace is the screen that appears after you open an existing 
   project or create a new project. It is the area where you do the work 
   of making your project.</P>

  <P>
   The screen has a central area where your project appears, surrounded 
   by toolbars for adding and modifying the <B>elements</B> in your 
   project. The workspace is where it all comes together... it's your 
   high-tech easel - complete with a host of powerful tools.</P>
