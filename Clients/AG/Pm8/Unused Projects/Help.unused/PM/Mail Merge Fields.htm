   Mail Merge Fields</H5>
  <P>
   Mail Merge fields are placeholders that can be &quot;filled-in&quot; 
   with personal information from your Address Book. This allows you to 
   address your card, envelope, or other project to more than one 
   person, and you won't need to change the text for each one. </P>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">To add a Mail Merge field to your project:</SPAN></P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Begin by adding a text box to your label project. If you are working 
    with a Ready Made project, delete the sample text in the text box, 
    but leave the empty box.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Make sure the empty text box is selected (the handles are showing 
    around it), and the insertion point (the blinking cursor) is placed 
    inside the text box.</P>
   </OL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    NOTE: Mail Merge fields do not have to be inserted into an empty text 
    box. They can also be added to text boxes that already contain 
    existing text. Mail Merge fields are inserted at the text cursor position.</P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <OL START="3">
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Under the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add</SPAN> menu, select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Mail
     Merge Field...</SPAN>. A list of available Mail Merge fields will 
    then appear. Use the scroll bar to the right to move up or down the 
    list of fields.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Pick a Mail Merge field by clicking on its name.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Insert</SPAN> button to 
    add the selected field to your project page. </P>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">Or, to more 
    easily insert standard information:</SPAN></P>
   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Click <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Receiver Address</SPAN> to 
     automatically insert Receiver First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, 
     Address1, Address2, City, State, and Zip fields. This is often the 
     best selection when you are sending out lots of mailers, envelopes, 
     or invitations with a different name and address on each item.</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Click <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Sender Address</SPAN> to 
     automatically insert the Sender First Name, Last Name, Title, 
     Company, Address1, Address2, City, State, and Zip fields. This will 
     create a series of labels with your name and address on each. This is 
     best when you want to create many identical return address labels, 
     cassette labels, books plates, or business cards.</P>
