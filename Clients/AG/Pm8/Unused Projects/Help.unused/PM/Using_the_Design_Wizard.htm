   button in the Hub screen opens a small window (known as a 
   &quot;wizard&quot;) where you will answer a few questions about the 
   project you wish to create. The questions you&#146;ll answer will 
   vary, depending on the selections you make. Make your selections by 
   clicking on one of the choices. The box or circle beside the 
   selection shows the choice you made.</P>

   After making your selections, the <A HREF="The_Design_Workspace.htm">design
    workspace</A> appears, and you're ready to work on your project.
