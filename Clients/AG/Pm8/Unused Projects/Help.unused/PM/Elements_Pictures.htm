    displays your images and shapes on screen so you can easily tell 
   what your page will look like when printed. When you select a image 
   or shape to work on, PrintMaster places a frame around it to indicate 
   its exact position and size.</P>

   The Art Gallery contains thousands of drawings, photos, borders, and

   If your image is too big or too small to fit properly in your 
   project, the following steps will help you resize your image:</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Make sure your image is &#145;active&#146; (handles showing around 
    its edges). If it is not, click directly on your image to make it 
    active. If you are having trouble selecting your image, hit the Tab 
    key to cycle through the different levels of objects in your project 
    until your image is active.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Once your image is active, place the cursor on the handle (the small 
    square box) on the bottom right corner of the image.</P>
   <UL>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Drag the mouse diagonally out and down to make the image larger.</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     Drag the mouse up and to the left to make the image smaller.</P>
    <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
    <P>
     To make sure the image keeps its exact proportions, hold down the 
     Control (Ctrl) key while dragging.</P>
    </UL>
   </OL>
  <P>
   <B><I>Cropping an image:</I></B></P>
  <P>
   Images may be too large or include things you&#146;d like to remove. 
   PrintMaster has a cropping tool that allows you to &#147;cut out&#148;
    a portion of the photo you want to see, without removing or 
   disturbing any part of the image.</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <I>Click the <B>Crop</B> tool on the <B>Modify</B> toolbar</I></P>
   <P>
    Make sure you first select the image you want (handles are showing 
    around its edges).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">Place the cursor over any handle 
    of the image.</SPAN></P>
   <P>
    The cursor will turn into a cropping tool. You can now drag the 
    handle to create a new window through which you will view your image.</P>
   </OL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Note:</SPAN> You are not altering 
    the image, you are just reducing or enlarging the &#145;window&#146; 
    through which you can see that image.</P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <OL START="3">
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;">With your image still active and 
    the cropping tool button selected, place the cursor over the center 
    of the image.</SPAN></P>
   <P>
    The cursor will turn into a &#145;move&#146; hand. By clicking and 
    dragging your image, you can move the image within the cropped window 
    to see only the portion of the image you want.</P>
