   <P>
    Click the BorderPlus! icon in the Workspace.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Drag the text tool across your label to create the outside dimensions 
    of your border. When you release the mouse, BorderPlus! will appear 
    and show you a blank border of the size you created in its window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    There are eight 'panels' to each border: the top, bottom, left, and 
    right sides, and the four corners. When you open BorderPlus!, all 
    eight panels are selected. </P>
   </OL>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    NOTE: When you import a picture to fill one of the panels, the panel 
    must first be selected. To select or deselect a panel, click on it 
    once. </P>

  <OL START="4">
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click the Art Gallery button to open the Art Gallery. Select a 
    picture to be repeated in your border panel, or use Import From Disk 
    to bring in any other picture you might want to use. </P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Adjust the width of the different border panels by dragging the 
    inside edge of the border with your mouse.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When you are finished with your border, click the Close button, or 
    select Done Editing Border... from the File menu. Your border will be 
    placed on your project. You can now move or resize it as you would 
    any picture object.
