   Most printers support a number of different print quality choices. 
   Click on the Print Quality list box to make your selection. 
   Generally, a low resolution or low quality setting will result in 
   faster printing times&#151;useful for printing a quick rough draft or 
   a very large project that will be viewed from a distance. A high 
   resolution or high quality setting will give you the best output, but 
   will probably take longer to print&#151;use high quality for your 
   final printout.
