   Double-sided Printing</H6>
  <P>
   PrintMaster includes an easy-to-use Double-Sided Wizard to help you 
   determine the best way to print your double-sided print projects.</P>
  <P>
   The Double-Sided Print Wizard takes you step-by-step through a sample 
   printing project, and according to your responses, configures 
   PrintMaster to print double-sided projects automatically in the future.</P>

   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <I>Once your double-sided project is complete, select the Print 
    button on the File menu or type Ctrl+P.</I></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <I>Make sure <B>Double-sided</B> is checked on the Print dialog box, 
    then click the <B>Print</B> button.</I></P>
   <P>
    The first time you print a double-sided project, the Double-Sided 
    Wizard appears. If you have not yet set your double-sided print 
    configuration and the Wizard does not appear, select <B>Double-Sided 
    Print Setup...</B> under the <B>File</B> menu.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <I>The Double-Sided Print Wizard asks you to print a 2-page test project.</I></P>
   <P>
    After the two pages are printed, follow the directions on the Wizard 
    screen. You will be asked to match the printed pages to icons on the 
    Wizard screen, place the pages back in the printer, print again, then 
    select the configuration that matches the final print out order.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Once you have answered the questions on the Wizard screen, click 
    Finish. PrintMaster is now set up for double-sided printing. You can 
    now print multiple-page, double-sided projects such as newsletters, 
    cards, and envelopes.
