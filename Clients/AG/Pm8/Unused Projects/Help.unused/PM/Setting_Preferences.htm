   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;font-size : 10.0pt;">Hints:</SPAN><BR>
   PrintMaster includes two types of &quot;hints&quot;-pop-up windows 
   with text information-that can guide you through your projects. 
   Helpful Hints present useful information about creating projects, 
   aligning pictures, and introduce new areas of PrintMaster. Design 
   Tips are professional tips for creating beautiful and well-designed projects.</P>
  <P>
   To turn off or reset either of the hint windows:</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select the Hint tab at the top of the Preferences dialog.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select or deselect the check boxes for each type of hint.</P>
   <P>
    After most hints are presented once or twice, they will not show up 
    again (unless you select them from the <A HREF="Hints.htm">Recent Hints</A> 
    menu). If you would like to reset all of the hints so you can see all 
    of them again, click <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Reset All Hints</SPAN>.</P>

   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;font-size : 10.0pt;">Workspace
    Preferences</SPAN><BR>
   Since your hard disk is faster than your CD-ROM player, PrintMaster 
   improves performance by using a file on your hard disk to store the 
   most frequently used information. This hard disk file is called the 
   workspace file.</P>
  <P>
   Type in a new workspace size to change this value.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A larger workspace uses more hard disk space but enables you to 
    access fonts and graphics far more quickly.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    A smaller workspace uses less hard disk space but takes longer to 
    access the fonts and graphics.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;font-size : 10.0pt;">Online:</SPAN><BR>
   In order to access the <A HREF="Online Art Gallery.htm">Online Art Gallery</A> 
   or send an <A HREF="PrintMaster_Gold_on_the_Internet.htm">Online Greeting</A>,
    you will need to connect to the Internet through a modem or direct 
   connection. Select the Online tab in the Preferences dialog to select 
   which type of connection you will be using. If you are using a 
   dial-up modem connection, select Properties... to properly configure 
   your modem connection properties and select the browser you will be using.</P>
