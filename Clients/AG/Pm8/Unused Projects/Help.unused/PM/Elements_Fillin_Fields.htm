   <P>
    Create a blank text box by selecting 'Text Box' from the Add menu, or 
    by clicking the Text Box icon on the Edit Bar.</P>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    NOTE: Fill-in fields do not have to be inserted into an empty text 
    box. They can also be added to text boxes that already contain 
    existing text. Mail Merge fields are inserted at the text cursor position.</P>
   </OL>
  <OL START="2">
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Fill-in Fields</SPAN> from 
    the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools</SPAN> menu, then select 
    the '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add Fill-in field</SPAN>' command.</P>
   <P>
    A list of available field names will appear on the left side of the 
    Add Field dialog box. Select a field and press 'Insert'. You can 
    repeat this process as many times as necessary.</P>
   </OL>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To add a custom field, click the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add</SPAN> 
    button in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add Field</SPAN> 
    dialog box and enter a name for your new field.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To automatically merge information from the Receivers List of your 
    Address Book, click the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Receiver...</SPAN> 
    button. The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Select Merge Names</SPAN> 
    command in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools</SPAN> menu 
    takes you to the Receiver's Address Book.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Pick the receiver name(s) you wish to use by clicking on them with 
    your mouse, or press the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Select All </SPAN>button
     to include all of them.</P>
   </UL>
  <OL START="3">
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Once you have chosen the desired name(s), click <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">OK</SPAN>.</P>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    Note: When selecting multiple receiver names, only one of the chosen 
    names will appear on the project page (generally the first one 
    selected). You will also only see one name listed in Print Preview. 
    However, upon printing your project each printed page will contain a 
    different receiver name.</P>
   <P>
    The fill-in fields seen earlier have been replaced by the first name 
    in the receiver list you selected. At this point, you can begin 
    editing the way your text will look by changing fonts, font color and 
    size, and other properties.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    When you are done, click '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">OK</SPAN>'.
     The fill-in field is placed on your project where you positioned 
    your text box, and can be moved and sized just like a text box.</P>
   </OL>
  <P>
   <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;font-weight : bold;">To modify a 
   fill-in field:</SPAN><BR>
   Once you have placed fill-in fields onto your project page you can 
   quickly change the values in each of the inserted fields.</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Fill-in fields</SPAN> from 
    the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools</SPAN> menu, then select '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Edit
     Fill-in fields</SPAN>'.</P>
   <P>
    All the fields in your project appear in the Fields dialog box.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Use Tab and Shift+Tab to move to the next field or to back up to a 
    prior field. You can change what each field will say by entering text 
    in the 'Fill-in Value' box: this text will appear on the project in 
    place of the standard text. (For example, to address members of a 
    bowling league, you might first add the fill-in field labeled 
    'Company' then edit it by entering 'League' or 'Team' in the Fill-in 
    Value box.)</P>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    Note: You can also select values from the Address Book so your 
    Address Book information merges automatically.</P>
   </OL>

   fill-in field:</SPAN><BR>
