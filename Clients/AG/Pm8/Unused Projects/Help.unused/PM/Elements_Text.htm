  <P>
   PrintMaster gives you the power to create text in almost any font, 
   size, shape and color you can imagine. If you are familiar with word 
   processing software, working with text in PrintMaster will seem very familiar.</P>
  <P>
   <B><I><SPAN STYLE="font-style : normal;font-size : 10.0pt;">The text box:</SPAN></I></B><BR>
   All text in PrintMaster projects appears inside a rectangular area 
   also known as a &#147;text box&#148; (sometimes referred to as a 
   &#147;frame&#148;). A text box is a single element containing as many 
   words as you like. As with other elements, you can click on the text 
   box and move it anywhere on the page.</P>

   <IMG SRC="00000012.gif" WIDTH="242" HEIGHT="87" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" ALT="images/00000012.gif" BORDER="0"></P>
  <P>
   The text in the box stays together as a unit, but you can create any 
   number of text boxes. If you click inside the text box, you can edit 
   the text as with any standard word processor (think of text boxes as 
   miniature document windows).</P>
