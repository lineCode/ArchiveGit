   Arranging Elements:<BR>
   Using Layers</H4>
  <P>
   A project is like a stack of transparent layers piled on top of each 
   other. In PrintMaster, these layers fill the entire workspace. You 
   can see through any space in a layer that is not filled by an 
   element. Each layer can have one element on it or it can have a 
   &#147;group&#148; of elements.</P>
  <P>
   When you add an element (a text box, line, shape, or picture), you 
   add a new <I>layer</I> to the project. Each layer has its own place 
   in the stack. An element on one layer will cover an element on a 
   layer directly below. Elements <I>not</I> directly below are still 
   visible, because the layers are transparent.</P>
  <P>
   When you click on an element to select it, you are selecting the 
   entire layer. Use the <B><A HREF="Using_the_Popup_Menu.htm">popup</A></B> 
   menu, or the <B><A HREF="Arranging_Elements.htm">Arrange</A></B> menu 
   to bring an element in front of another. By changing the order of an 
   element&#146;s <I>layer</I> in the stack, you can place elements in 
   front, back, or anywhere in between other elements.</P>
