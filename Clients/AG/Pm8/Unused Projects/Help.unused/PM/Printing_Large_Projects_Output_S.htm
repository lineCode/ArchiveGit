   Printing Large Projects: Output Size</H6>
  <P>
   PrintMaster lets you take any project (e.g. cards, posters, banners) 
   and print it at any size, from as small as a postage stamp to as 
   large as a garage door. When you complete the project, you choose the 
   size you want from within the <B>Print</B> dialog box.</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <I>Click the <B>Print</B> button in the <B>File</B> toolbar, or the <B>Print...</B> 
    command in the <B>File</B> menu.</I></P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">

    If the printout is larger than a single sheet of paper it will print 
    on multiple sheets&#151;each sheet is called a tile. As you select 
    the output size, click the Which Tiles<I><B>...</B></I> button to see 
    a preview of the tile pattern in the final printout. When your 
    project has finished printing, assemble the tiles to create the final printout.</P>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    Note: PrintMaster maintains the relative proportions of the project. 
    Changing one dimension will change the other dimensions proportionally.</P>
