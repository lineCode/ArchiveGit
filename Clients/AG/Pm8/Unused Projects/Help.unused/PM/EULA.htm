  <P>
   All characters, designs, logos, text, photos, clip art, fonts, 
   graphics, templates, trademarks, and all other tools and projects 
   contained in PrintMaster (the &quot;Properties&quot;) are either 
   owned by or used under license by Mindscape, Inc. and protected under 
   trademark, copyright, and other applicable laws. You may use the 
   Properties to design your own creations, such as stationery, cards, 
   signs, invitations and other items, as indicated on the PrintMaster 
   box. This includes brochures, newsletters or other projects that 
   promote your business, event, organization, etc.; provided, however, 
   that although you may use the Properties to promote another business, 
   you may <B>not</B> make commercial use of a Property as your 
   business, nor may you use any of the Properties as a logo, trademark 
   or similar designation of your business.</P>
  <P>
   The Properties may be used for home entertainment, personal and 
   educational purposes. Certain of the Properties may be used as an 
   incidental part of a product distributed commercially for profit or 
   resale. Such use, however, must not be a substantial portion of the 
   value of the product -- for example, you may not use a Property on a 
   poster, greeting card, bumper sticker, or a T-shirt featuring that 
   Property and then sell or attempt to sell your creation. THESE RIGHTS 
   ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ALL PROPERTIES IN THE PRODUCT. THEY ARE ONLY 
   AVAILABLE FOR A SELECT PORTION OF THE PROPERTIES INCLUDED IN 
   PRINTMASTER. These rights are not available for any design or verse 
   identified as American Greetings. The Properties available for this 
   use can be identified by either searching by the keyword 
   &quot;EULA&quot; or by right clicking on the image and verifying that 
   the word &quot;EULA&quot; is included in the list of keywords. If 
   &quot;EULA&quot; does not appear, then the Property cannot be used 
   for any commercially distributed product and is available for 
   personal use only. These designs are owned by Mindscape and its 
   licensors, it is a violation of your license and copyright law to use 
   a PrintMaster Property in this way. All rights in any derivative 
   works created by the use of a Property shall vest exclusively in 
   Mindscape or its licensors. These Properties may not be copied or 
   downloaded in whole or in part except in the normal private use of
