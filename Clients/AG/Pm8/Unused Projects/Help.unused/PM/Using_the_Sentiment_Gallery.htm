   Using the Sentiment Gallery</H5>
  <P>
   The Sentiment Gallery contains hundreds of sayings, phrases, and 
   messages to add to your project. Each sentiment is in two parts: the 
   phrase that will appear on the front of the project, and the phrase 
   that will appear on the inside of the project. After you select the 
   appropriate sentiment, each phrase automatically appears in a text 
   box in your project.</P>
  <P>
   Like the Art and Project Browsers, the Sentiment Gallery allows you 
   to search by Category (from Anniversary to Wedding) and Tone 
   (Humorous, Sentimental, Traditional, Contemporary, and Spiritual). 
   You can also type a word in the Keyword box and PrintMaster will find 
   all sentiments that match your request.</P>
