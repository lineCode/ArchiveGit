   Applying Values to Fill-in Fields</H6>
  <P>
   Once you have placed fill-in fields onto your project page you will 
   need to assign values to each of the inserted fields.</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To begin, you must first create a blank text box by selecting '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Text
     Box</SPAN>' from the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add</SPAN> 
    menu, or by clicking the Text Box icon on the Edit Bar. Select 
    Fill-in Fields from the Tools menu, then select the '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add
     Fill-in field</SPAN>' command.</P>
   <P>
    A list of available field names will appear on the left side of the 
    Add Field dialog box. Select a field and press 'Insert'. You can 
    repeat this process as many times as necessary.</P>
   <P>
    To add a custom field, click the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add</SPAN> 
    button in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Add Field</SPAN> 
    dialog box and enter a name for your new field.</P>
   <P>
    When you are done, click '<SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">OK</SPAN>'.
     The fill-in field is placed on your project where you positioned 
    your text box, and can be moved and sized just like a text box.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    To edit a field, again select <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Fill-in
     fields</SPAN> from the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools</SPAN> 
    menu, then select 'Edit Fill-in fields'. Your fields appear in the 
    Fields dialog box.</P>
   <P>
    Use Tab and Shift+Tab to move to the next field or to back up to a 
    prior field. You can determine what each field will say by entering 
    text in the 'Fill-in Value' box: this text will appear on the project 
    in place of the standard text. (For example, to address members of a 
    bowling league, you might first add the fill-in field labeled 
    'Company' then edit it by entering 'League' or 'Team' in the Fill-in 
    Value box.)</P>
   <P>
    You can also select values from the Address Book so your Address Book 
    information merges automatically.</P>
   <P>
    To automatically merge information from the Receivers List of your 
    Address Book, click the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Receiver...</SPAN> 
    button. The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Select Merge Names</SPAN> 
    command in the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tools</SPAN> menu 
    takes you to the Receiver's Address Book.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Pick the receiver name(s) you wish to use by clicking on them with 
    your mouse, or press the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Select All </SPAN>button
     to include all of them.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Once you have chosen the desired name(s), click <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">OK</SPAN>.</P>
   <P CLASS="Note">
    Note: When selecting multiple receiver names, only one of the chosen 
    names will appear on the project page (generally the first one 
    selected). You will also only see one name listed in Print Preview. 
    However, upon printing your project each printed page will contain a 
    different receiver name.</P>
   <P>
    The fill-in fields seen earlier have been replaced by the first name 
    in the receiver list you selected. At this point, you can begin 
    editing the way your text will look by changing fonts, font color and 
    size, and other properties.
