  <P>
   Use the <B>Attributes</B> command in the Format menu or the popup 
   menu to change the printing attributes of the currently selected picture.</P>
  <P>
   Select the Render Method and Coloring Book options in this dialog. 
   Some options may not be available for certain types of pictures in 
   which case they will be &#147;grayed out&#148;. In general, the 
   Render Method option applies to pictures in a bitmapped format such 
   as TIF or PCX. The coloring book option is available for CGM pictures.</P>
  <P>
   <B>Render Method:</B></P>
  <P>
   Use Render Method to adjust the way PrintMaster combines colored dots 
   to simulate color shading and gray tones in bitmapped graphics. Most 
   bitmapped graphics have more colors or grays than the output device 
   (screen or printer) is capable of showing. PrintMaster uses two 
   methods to approximate those colors as well as possible on an output 
   device. For example, consider an image with 256 colors on a printer 
   that supports only 16 colors. PrintMaster makes the 256 colors appear 
   by mixing the 16 colors available.</P>
  <P>
   The general name for processing an image for the screen or printer is 
   &#147;rendering&#148;. The specific rendering methods available in 
   PrintMaster are Ordered Dither and Error Diffusion.</P>
  <UL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <B><I>Ordered Dither</I></B></P>
   <P>
    An Ordered Dither uses a fixed set of patterns to blend colors. Each 
    color or gray in the image changes to a pattern of colors on the 
    output device. The appearance of the resulting image is very regular.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    <B><I>Error Diffusion</I></B></P>
   <P>
    Error Diffusion on the other hand, is a dynamic process. It creates 
    patterns &#147;on-the-fly&#148;, and the resulting patterns tend to 
    be more dense and unique. Images often look better with Error 
    Diffusion, though the patterns look very unusual when viewed up 
    close. Also, because Error Diffusion patterns are denser, the image 
    tends to darken due to bleeding of ink or toner when the image is 
    printed. This means that if you use Error Diffusion, you will 
    probably also need to adjust your printer contrast to lighten the image.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   <B>Coloring Book:</B></P>
  <P>
   Select Coloring Book to print only the outline of the selected 
   picture, with the color fills printed as white. The final printout 
   can be colored using crayons or pens.</P>
  <P>
   <B>Picture Color:</B></P>
  <P>
   Change the color of a selected picture can be changed by clicking on 
   a color name in the list. Clicking the <B>More...</B> button lets you 
   pick colors from the Windows Color dialog or define your own custom colors.</P>
  <P>
   Most of the pictures included with PrintMaster contain many different 
   colors. When you change the &#147;color&#148; of these pictures, 
   PrintMaster will change all the black parts of the picture to the 
   selected color. The other colors in the picture may get lighter, 
   darker, or change hue depending on the original picture color and the 
   color to which the picture is changing. Only pictures that are all 
   black will completely change to the selected color.
