   Scanning pictures and graphics.</H4>
  <P>
   PrintMaster includes all the tools you&#146;ll need to put photos and 
   graphics into your projects. PrintMaster includes TWAIN support so 
   you can easily acquire images from a flatbed scanner, digital cameras 
   and more.</P>
  <P CLASS="Note">
   Note: Before Acquiring an image in PrintMaster, you will first need 
   to install the scanning software and drivers that came with your 
   scanner or digital camera.</P>

   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Under the <B>File</B> menu, click <B>Acquire</B>. This will launch 
    the scanning software that came with your camera or scanner.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Scan your image according to the directions that came with your 
    scanner or digital camera. The TWAIN support within PrintMaster will 
    allow you to easily transport that image into PrintMaster.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Once you scan the image, the Save Acquired Picture window appears. 
    Here, type in a name for your new scanned image, and if you like, a 
    description of the image. If you would like the scanned image to show 
    up in the Art Gallery in the future, click the box at the bottom of 
    the window.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Click OK. Your scanned image appears in the middle of your project in 
    the Workspace.</P>

   <P>
    Keep your files small. Large bitmaps like color photos can slow your 
    screen display considerably and will take up a lot of hard disk space.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    You can control the dots per inch (dpi) that your scanner creates as 
    it scans the picture. The more dots per inch your scanner reads, the 
    more information it will store in the image, and the bigger the size 
    of the resulting file. As a rule, don&#146;t scan at a higher dpi 
    than your printer can print. In fact, scans often look best 50 to 100 
    dpi less than your printer can print (often 300 dpi).</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Remember that when you scan a picture, whether you found it in a 
    magazine or a book from the library, the picture is someone&#146;s 
    original work and still belongs to them. If you intend to publish 
    your PrintMaster project, you must receive written permission from 
    the artist or owner, even if you alter the picture beyond recognition.
