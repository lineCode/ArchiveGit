   Clicking the <B>Brand New</B> button in the Hub screen opens the <A HREF="Popup_NewProject.htm">New
    Project</A> screen -- a small window (known as a &quot;wizard&quot;) 
   where you will choose the type of project and answer a question or 
   two about the project you wish to create.</P>
  <P>
   After making your selections, the design window appears, and you're 
   ready to work on your project. PrintMaster creates the document you 
   see on the screen from the selections you made.</P>
