   Creating New Documents</H2>
  <P>
   In PrintMaster, there are three ways to begin creating a new document:</P>
  <OL>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Choose one of the many <A HREF="Using_ReadyMade_Designs.htm">Ready-Made</A> 
    professional documents.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Create the project &quot;with help&quot; from the <A HREF="Using_the_Design_Wizard.htm">Design
     Wizard</A> to get you started.</P>
   <LI CLASS="mvd-P">
   <P>
    Create a <A HREF="Creating_a_Brand_New_Project.htm">Brand New</A> 
    document on your own.</P>
   </OL>
  <P>
   You can begin creating your document from almost any place in 
   PrintMaster. Each of the methods above corresponds to a button in the 
   &#147;Hub&#148; or opening screen, and also to a button in the 
   &#147;global&#148; toolbar of the Design Workspace.
