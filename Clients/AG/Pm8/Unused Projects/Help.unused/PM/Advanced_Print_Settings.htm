  <P>
   Use the Outline Picture Contrast slider to adjust the lightness or 
   darkness of printed outline images such as CGM and WMF graphics. Use 
   the Bitmap Picture Contrast slider to adjust the lightness or 
   darkness of printed bitmap images such as graphics in the TIF, PCX or 
   BMP formats.</P>
  <P>
   <B><I>Picture Contrast:</I></B></P>
  <P>
   Picture Contrast does not effect text or other items such as Calendar 
   lines. If images are printing too dark, adjust the slider to the 
   left, towards the word Light. If images are printing too light, 
   adjust the slider to the right, towards the word Dark. A setting of 
   1000 will cause PrintMaster to send images to the printer without any 
   contrast adjustments.</P>
  <P CLASS="Note">
   <I>Note: Dot matrix and HP DeskJet printers can sometimes print too 
   dark or too light. Use the Picture Contrast controls to lighten or 
   darken the printout.</I>
