If you've already created projects in @@N, this is where you can view and select them. 

If you have created numerous projects, you may want to sort them by Type, Category, or Tone. Or, type in a keyword and I'll search for you.

Note: If you decide you'd rather work on one of a Ready-Made, just select PrintMaster under Project Type and select the type of project you want to work on.
