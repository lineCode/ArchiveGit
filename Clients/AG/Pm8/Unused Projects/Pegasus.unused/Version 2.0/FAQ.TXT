PICTools version 2.00.51

This file contains the answers to some questions which are frequently
answered our Technical Support Department.
=====================================================================


Q. I just started using the PICTools libraries, but my programs crashes
   in the Pegasus DLL whenever I call Pegasus().
A. Be sure to zero the PIC_PARM structure using memset() before your
   other PIC_PARM initialization and before passing the structure to
   Pegasus().

Q. I don't get the last strip of my image when I decompress it.
A. If you are responding to the RES_PUT_NEED_SPACE event to display or
   write the DIB, remember that additional output is placed in the
   buffer after the final RES_PUT_NEED_SPACE event.  You will need to
   add code after the response/request loop to retrieve the final strip.

Q. My application used to work, but I got a new version of the DLL's and
   now I get a -2101 error.
A. You must set the PicParm.ParmVer to the appropriate value for the
   Development Kit whose DLL's you are using. The correct value to
   use is the CURRENT_PARMVER, defined in the PIC.H you received for
   the new Development Kit.
