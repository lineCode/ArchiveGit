class AL_CLASS_TYPE ALEntry;

/*
 * class ALMonitor
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *  The ALMonitor class is used primarily for providing user interface
 *  information during archiving or other operations.  Each ALEntryList
 *  object has an ALMonitor attached to it.  When the archive operations
 *  are performed, the ALMonitor object is called using its two functions,
 *  Progress() and ArchiveOperation().  Progress() is used to update
 *  progress information, such as byte count or percent complete.  The
 *  archive operation is functioned at various times, such as when files
 *  are opened, archives are opened, files are closed, etc.
 *
 *  Good examples of how derived classes do all this stuff can be found in
 *  BARGRAPH.CPP and WINMON.CPP.
 *
 * DATA MEMBERS
 *
 *  mlJobSize       : The total size of the job being monitored.  If the
 *                    monitor is in AL_MONITOR_JOBS mode, we care about
 *                    this. The archive base class has to set up this
 *                    member before the archiving procedure starts.
 *
 *  mlJobSoFar      : The total number of bytes that have already been
 *                    processed so far in this job.  This number is
 *                    updated after each file is completely processed.  It
 *                    does not reflect work done on the current file.
 *
 *  mlObjectSize    : The size of the current object being processed.  This
 *                    is usually set up by the archive function at the start
 *                    of processing for the current file.  If this number is
 *                    set to -1, it means we have to check on it, since
 *                    the archiving program was to lazy to open the file and
 *                    calculate it.
 *
 *  mlObjectStart   : The starting offset of the current object in the
 *                    file being processed.  Sometimes the object we are
 *                    working on might be in an archive, in which case
 *                    we need to know where it starts.
 *
 *  mlByteCount     : This private member contains the byte count for all
 *                    the data processed so far.  Derived classes can
 *                    call Progress() for the base class, and it will
 *                    calculate this number.  The number will be for
 *                    the entire job when we are in AL_MONITOR_JOB mode,
 *                    but just for the current object when we are in
 *                    AL_MONITOR_OBJECTS mode.
 *
 *  miRatio         : The percentage of processing we have completed, an
 *                    integer that hopefully ranges from 0 to 100.  This
 *                    number can also be calculated by calling Progress()
 *                    in the base class.  It will differ depending on whether
 *                    we are in AL_MONITOR_JOB mode or AL_MONITOR_OBJECTS.
 *
 *  miMonitorType   : Either AL_MONITOR_OBJECT or AL_MONITOR_JOBS, depending
 *                    on what was specified in the constructor.
 *
 * MEMBER FUNCTIONS
 *
 *  ALMonitor()        : The constructor.
 *  ~ALMonitor()       : The virtual destructor.
 *  operator new()     : The memory allocation operator used when the
 *                       library resides in a DLL.
 *  Progress()         : The routine called periodically to update progress
 *                       indicators.  The base class version just makes
 *                       calculations.
 *  ArchiveOperation() : The routine called at various points during an
 *                       archive operation.  Does nothing worthwhile in the
 *                       base class.
