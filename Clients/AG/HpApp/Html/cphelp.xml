		<content>
		Starting at the home page of HP Design Studio, you can browse through all of the available categories
		of projects to find one that meets your needs.
		<ol>
			<li>The left side of the page will allow you to navigate through the project design <b>categories</b>.
			Click on the category names to open and explore them.</li>
			<li>The right side of the page will show you the <b>thumbnail images</b> of various projects in that category.</li>
			<li>To see a larger <b>preview</b> of the project, click on the thumbnail image.</li>
			<li>If you would like to view more projects you can click the <b>Back</b> button to return to the thumbnails
			page, or you can just select a new category.</li>
			<li>Continue to browse until you find the right project for your needs.  Click on the <b>Personalize and Print This Project</b> link to open up
			the <b>HP Design Studio Workspace</b>.  In the workspace, you can personalize your
			project by changing the text, adding new text messages, adding a favorite
			photo, and so much more.  Have fun!</li>
			<li>When you have completed your personalizations, click the <b>Print</b> button.  Your project will be sent to your printer.</li>
		</ol>
		<b>Tips:</b>
		<br />
		<br />
		The first time you print a note card or greeting card,
		be sure to run a <b>paper feed print test</b> in the Print window. 
		You’ll only need to do this the first time you print a card and HP Design Studio will remember your settings.
		<br />
		<br />
		All text on the HP Design Studio greeting cards and projects can be edited to
		fit your specific need.  If you see a Floral design in Thank you that you think
		would make a great Anniversary greeting, just change the text message.  It is easy, fast and
		fun!

		After you have chosen the project you want to personalize, click on the <b>Personalize
		and Print This Project</b> link and the HP Design Studio
		Workspace window will pop up.  The Workspace is where you can
		personalize and print your greeting card or project.  You can add, delete, or
		change text and art elements.<br />
		<br />
		You can start by simply highlighting the
		project's existing text message and begin typing.  Your keystrokes will change
		the sentiment right on your screen.  You can also change the size, color,
		alignment and type of font used on your project, and add shapes or photos.<br />
		<br />
		There are many other tools available in the workspace if you wish to create a
		truly unique printed project.  Each button icon represents one of the tools in the workshop.  If you need a quick hint as to what each tool does,
		place the cursor over the tool icon.  Hold the pointer over the tool icon

		HP Design Studio is set up to print 4x8 Photo Cards correctly on HP printers.

		<content>
		<ul>
			<li>Handle paper by the edges to avoid fingerprints.</li>
			<li>Keep a minimum of 10 sheets in the input tray.</li>
			<li>Use only flat paper. In very low humidity, the paper might curl, which can skew the image. If the paper curls, put it back in the plastic bag and gently bend the stack of paper back until it is flat and then load it.</li>
			<li>Use paper under the following conditions: 15 to 25ºC (50 to 91ºF) and 20 to 80 percent relative humidity.</li>
		</ul>
		For HP Deskjet printers, HP all-in-ones, and HP Photosmart printers (except HP Photosmart 100, 200, and 300 series printers).<br />
		<br />
		TIP: For best results, load the paper into the standard input tray.<br />
		<ol>
			<li>Insert the photo paper into the standard input tray with the perforated, tabbed edge toward you with the HP logos facing up.</li>
			<li>Adjust the paper width and length guides in the standard input tray to fit closely to the edges of the paper.</li>

		<content>
		All printers feed custom sized paper differently.  In order for HP Design Studio to determine how to print on 4X8 Photo Cards using your printer, you need to set the Paper Feed Settings within the Print dialog box.  To do this:<br />
		<br />
		<ol>
			<li>Click <b>Paper Feed Settings</b> located within the print dialog box.</li>
			<li>Under <b>Feeds from:</b>, if the Right option is selected, then change to Left.  If the Left option is selected, then change to Right.  In other words, opposite of the way it was set when you entered the Paper Feed Settings dialog.</li>
			<li>Click OK to save changes and reprint your card.</li>
			<li>If the above steps do not work you will need to recalibrate your printer. Please refer to your printers manual for instructions.</li>

		<content>
		You can add a photo to any HP Design Studio project.  Some projects are 
		specifically designed as Add-A-Photo projects, with a space for your photo 
		incorporated into the project layout.  But photos can be added to all projects.  You
		just need to decide where to feature the photo.<br />
		<br />
		<b>Add-A-Photo projects:<br />
		</b>
		<br />
		If you have chosen a project that incorporates the Add-A-Photo feature in its 
		design, you can simply double-click on the words <b>"Double-Click to Add-A-Photo®"</b> to place an image
		within the card or project.<br />
		<br />
		The Add-A-Photo dialog box will open.  Browse your hard drive for the photo 
		you would like to attach to the project.  When you have found it, click the <b>Open</b> button.  The
		picture will insert itself into he designed location.<br />
		<br />
		<b>All Projects:<br />
		</b>
		<br />
		Click on the <b>Photo</b> button located in the left hand tool bar.  The Add-A-Photo 
		dialog box will open and you can browse your hard drive to find a photo.  When you 
		find the one you want, click the <b>Open</b> button.  The photo will be dropped in the center of the 
		project.  Double-click on the inserted photo to move it anywhere on the
		project, or to resize it.<br />
		<br />
		<b>Resizing and moving photos:<br />
		</b>
		<br />
		To resize a photo, click the photo to select it, and then drag the handles in any direction to make the photo the size you would like.  
		Dragging the photo by the corners will maintain the aspect ratio and will not distort the image.<br />
		<br />
		To move a photo, click and drag it from any point within the photo and move it to a different location.  Use the arrow keys on the keboard to "tweak" the location by a very small amount.<br />

		<content>
		HP paper products are specially designed to work with HP printers, HP inks and HP Design Studio, and are available at most office supply 
		stores and many department stores.  HP greeting card and note card stock are comparable to store-bought

		heavyweight paper may also be used for your HP Design Studio projects.

		Half-fold greetings print on both sides of the paper.  You will have to 
		reinsert the paper to print on both sides.  After HP Design Studio has checked 
		to see what type of printer you have, it may need to run a <b>paper feed print test</b> using a single 
		sheet of plain paper.  Next, a series of dialog boxes will give you the exact instructions 
		specific to your printer.  Simply follow the instructions, click the <b>Next</b>
