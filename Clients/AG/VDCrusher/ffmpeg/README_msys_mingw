To compile ffmpeg for windows, I had to install msys and mingw on my PC.

http://www.mingw.org

I remembered it wasn't the easiest thing in the world. 
You have to install the packages in the correct order. 
I found the following mingw's Wiki page to be helpful.

http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/GettingStarted?PHPSESSID=d9c03d1d911a252f6e3055d4a46275ee

1. Downloaded SDL-1.2.8-mingwPORT.tar.bz2, 
              zlib-1.2.3-mingwPORT.tar.bz2
   from http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml
   and installed.

2. Also downloaded "lame-3.96.1" from
http://www.mp3dev.org

Used:
make -fMakefile.unix UNAME=MSDOS NOUNIXCMD=NO 
to compile and install it. lame is necessary
for generating audio portion of the .flv.

3. Download the latest ffmpeg

cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@mplayerhq.hu:/cvsroot/ffmpeg co ffmpeg

4. Configure ffmpeg with:

./configure --enable-memalign-hack --enable-shared --enable-mp3lame --enable-mingw32 --prefix=/c/ffmpeg

run make and make install.

5. Other changes:

Added the following line in the beginning of the msys.bat

call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"

msys.bat is in msys\1.0 directory.

6. To generate the necessary .lib using .def, run the following:
lib /def:avcodec.def /machine:i386 /out:avcodec.lib
etc..
