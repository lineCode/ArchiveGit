Code Generation Settings:

	Runtime DLLs:

	I have discoovered problems with Zlib, and possibly Stonehnd
	when using the non-Debug runtime libraies.  Therefore, I changed
	all projects to use the "Debug Multithreaded DLL" selection for
	the Runtime Library (in Settings/C++ tab).
	A specific file that caused an exception in Zlib was "2014990f.ctp".

Optimizations:

	I think it is worth using the "Maximum speed" setting for 
	optimizations, even though it will produce a slightly larger
	executable.

C++ Language Settings:

	Enable Exception handling
