/*
 *	The access suite sends reload and unload messages to PICA plug-ins.
 *	They are used to inform the plug-in that it has just been loaded into
 *	RAM or is about to be unloaded. A plug-in is automatically loaded by
 *	PICA when the host app or another plug-in calls it or acquires a
 *	suite that it exports. A plug-in may be unloaded at any time if it
 *	is not being used.
 *
 *	"Reload" is the very first message that a PICA plug-in receives before
 *	it is started up (in this case the message really means "Load"). "Unload" is
 *	the very last message a plug-in receives after it is shut down. In between,
 *	a plug-in must be prepared to be unloaded and reloaded any time it is not
 *	being used. "Unload" is the plug-in's opportunity to save state information
 *	that it will re-instantiate when it is reloaded. How this is done depends
 *	on the platform and environment.
 *
 *	Here is the sequence of events:
 *
 *	1) Reload: plug-in does nothing, since it hasn't been started up yet.
 *	2) Startup: plug-in initializes globals, adds features to application.
 *	...
 *	n) Unload: plug-in saves globals (using the 'globals' field in the
 *	   SPMessageData structure).
 *	...
 *	o) Reload: plug-in restores globals.
 *	...
 *	p) Unload: plug-in saves globals.
 *	...
 *	z-1) Reload: plug-in restores globals.
 *	z) Shutdown: plug-in saves preferences, removes features from application.
 *
 *	In addition, a plug-in that exports a suite will need to unload and reload
 *	the suite's procedure pointers. Unloading the suite means stuffing the
 *	suite's procedure pointers with the address of the Undefined() function in
 *	the Basic suite (which is always available). This is a protective measure
 *	against other plug-ins that may mistakenly use the suite after they have
 *	released it. Reloading the suite means stuffing the suite's procedure
 *	pointers with the updated addresses of their functions, since the plug-in
 *	is likely to be in a new position in memory.
 *
 *	Example:
 *
 *	SPErr UnloadSuite( MySuite *mySuite, SPAccessMessage *message ) {
 *
 *		mySuite->functionA = (void *) message->d.basic->Undefined;
 *		mySuite->functionB = (void *) message->d.basic->Undefined;
 *
 *	}
 *
 *
 *	SPErr ReloadSuite( MySuite *mySuite, SPAccessMessage *message ) {
 *
 *		mySuite->functionA = functionA;
 *		mySuite->functionB = functionB;
 *
 *	}

/*
 *	kSPFlushAccessType is of interest only to the host application or to the
 *	rare plug-in that uses the Caches suite. It is the name of the object
 *	that the Access suite caches and which can be purged when the
 *	caches are flushed. During a cache flush the SPFlushCachesProc may be
 *	asked about purging one of these. The SPFlushCachesProc may make any calls
 *	to the Access suite to collect information about the SPAccessRef in
 *	question before deciding to purge it or not.
 *
 *	For example, an application may implement a strategy where filter plug-ins
 *	are purged before window plug-ins:
 *
 *	long myFlushCachesProc( char *type, void *data, SPErr *error ) {
 *	
 *		long flush = TRUE;
 *	
 *		if ( strcmp( type, kSPFlushAccessType ) == 0 ) {
 *	
 *			SPAccessRef access = data;
 *			SPPluginRef plugin = sAccess->GetAccessPlugin( access, error );
 *			fail( error );
 *
 *			switch ( myPluginType( plugin ) ) {
 *	
 *				case kMyFilterPlugin:
 *					if ( gPurgeLevel < kFilterPurgeLevel )
 *						flush = FALSE;
 *					break;
 *	
 *				case kMyWindowPlugin:

/*
 *	SPEntry is the prototype for a PICA plug-in's entry point. The parms
 *	'caller' and 'selector' tell why the plug-in is being called, and the
 *	'message' is any data associated with it. For example, when the Access
 *	suite calls a plug-in to tell it that it is being unloaded, the caller and
 *	selector are kSPAccessCaller and kSPAccessUnloadSelector (above), and the
 *	message is an SPAccessMessage (below).
 *
 *	The prototype is modified by SPAPI, which is used on some platforms to
 *	standardize the parameter-passing conventions. See SPTypes.h for details.

/*
 *	An SPAccessRef is an access path to an open PICA plug-in. It is
 *	returned when you acquire a plug-in (which may cause the plug-in to be
 *	reloaded) and given up when the plug-in is released. The SPAccessRef is
 *	used primarily for making calls to a plug-in.
 *
 *	Example:
 *
 *	SPErr SendMessage( SPPluginRef plugin, char *caller, char *selector, void *message, SPErr *error ) {
 *	
 *		SPErr result;
 *		SPAccessRef access;
 *

 *		fail( error );
 *	
 *		return result;
 *	
 *	}
 *
 *	Access paths are reference-counted, which means it's very important to
 *	balance all of your calls to AcquirePlugin() and ReleasePlugin(). It also
 *	means that you don't need to concern yourself with whether an access path
 *	to a given plug-in already exists. If the plug-in is not loaded, it is
 *	reloaded and a new access path is created. If it is already loaded, the
 *	existing access path is referenced and returned. A plug-in will be
 *	unloaded only if the reference count of its access path is zero.

 *	An SPPlatformAccessInfo is platform-specific information about the access
 *	path to an open plug-in. On the Mac it contains resource chain information
 *	and a time stamp of when it was last called. On Windows it contains the
 *	handle to the plug-in's library. These are used by plug-ins that export
 *	suites since they must manually establish a resource context within any of
 *	the suite procedures before they can access resources. This is not
 *	necessary when a plug-in is called through its entry point, since
 *	CallPlugin() sets up the resource context for you.

 *
 *	Given a reference to a PICA plug-in, AcquirePlugin() opens the plug-in

 *	use when calling the plug-in and which you must give to ReleasePlugin()
 *	when you are through.
 *
 *	Access paths are reference-counted, which means it's very important to

 *
 *	Here's a trick: You can acquire yourself if you want to stay loaded in
 *	memory even when you're not being reference by anyone.
 *
 *	PICA plug-ins rarely call one another directly. Usually program
 *	control flows from plug-in to plug-in through suites, which are layered on
 *	top of the Access suite. Plug-in adapters (plug-ins that provide protocol
 *	conversion to non-PICA plug-ins) will add their own access suites to
