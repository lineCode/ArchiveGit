wt 0.04:

- Stopped checking the return value of XStoreColors in x11graphics.c.  This
    function does not return a value.
- 'Sky walls' introduced
- Wall struct changed--removed obsolete bands field, added sky field
- static added to the definitions of functions that were declared static.
- Added Thomas Hamren's (d0hampe@dtek.chalmers.se) GIF87 code
- Cut in Sun Sparc compatibility fixes from Marinos Yannikos
    (nino@vmars.tuwien.ac.at)
- Another patch from Marinos Yannikos:  Fixed end_graphics in x11graphics.c
     to release shared memory
- Added a patch from Joseph Provine (provine@enel.ucalgary.ca) to support X
     servers without the shared memory extension.
- Changed the name of shminfo in x11graphics.c to xshminfo.  This avoids
     a name conflict on Alphas running OSF/1.  This fix from Castor Fu
     (castor@drizzle.stanford.edu)
- #included wt.h in every .c file
- X11 support for PseudoColor on TrueColor and DirectColor devices from
    Joseph Provine (provine@enel.ucalgary.ca)
- Removed obsolete TEST_ASM #define
- Removed extra header files included in linux-console.c
- Added Pekka Pietik{inen's (pp@lyseo.otol.fi) linux mouse support code.


wt 0.03:

- Changed texture file format to something that is more portable.  The texture
    header is now ASCII.
- Added acceleration/deceleration hack to wt.c to make the motion smoother.
- Fixed up the Linux console code to use RAW mode.  Thanks to Pekka
    Pietik{inen (pp@lyseo.otol.fi) for the patches.
- Added page flipping with the svgalib version.  This patch is from
    Harm Hanemaayer (hhanemaa@cs.ruu.nl)
- Fixed bug in end_graphics in x11graphics.c.  Infinite recursion could
    result if there was an error freeing up memory.
- Got rid of input.c, linux-console.h, and x11input.h in one fell swoop.
    The input module interface is now simpler, resembling the graphics
    module interface.
- Optimizations and cleanups in render.c.  I don't think that any of these
    optimizations are significant enough to be noticeable.  One of them
    made the code cleaner as well as faster.  The other will likely be
    important once wt has to deal with larger world files.


wt 0.02b:

- *Really* added the endianness patches to texture.c


wt 0.02a:

- Fixed broken architecture non-specific code in slice.c and fixed.h
- Added endianness patches to texture.c


wt 0.02:  First source release

- Added ceilings.
- Fixed a floors bug which caused floors to be displayed incorrectly
    when view from certain angles.
- Makefile and #defines cleaned up to make it easy to port wt.


wt 0.01:  Initial release--Linux binaries only
