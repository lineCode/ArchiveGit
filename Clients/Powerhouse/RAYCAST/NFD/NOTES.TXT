	Some Timing Analysis

timing intervals approximately five minutes.
initial STANDARD timing achieved with the following enabled:
	cross hairs
	pistol sight
	music
	sound fx
	background paints
	status window
	map windows

10.42	Standard
12.29	wo/walls drawn
15.33	wo/walls or objects drawn
18.00	wo/everything (except background(fastest possible, 55ms interval))


6:38AM  3/4/95

converted xRay, yRay and long_sqrt functions to inline functions.
this reduced execution time by eliminating the overhead of passing
parameters via the stack.

10.79	Standard

6:44AM  3/28/95

timing intervals after adding:
	floor squares
	up/down movement (jogging, jumping)
	low/high resolution modes

 9.63	Standard (old map)
14.92	low resolution mode (old map)
10.66	Standard (new map)
15.66	low resolution mode (new map)
