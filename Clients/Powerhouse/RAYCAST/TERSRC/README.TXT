Here is source code to the Gouraud surface renderer previously uploaded.
Hopefully it will help illustrate another use for raycasting.

Note that:
	* Time Clarke did it first 
	* New 'Sect()' functions can be written to implement texture mapping
	* The comments are strange, mail me if you need clarification
	* Written for Watcom 10, but should be adaptable
	* Striations on the obelisk are why texture mapping is hard
