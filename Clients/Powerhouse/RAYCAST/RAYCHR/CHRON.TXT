This is the fisrt version of a reycaster. For now it is a Wolf 3d raycaster 
that works with an ASCII 2d map. I'm including the source code.
Needs a lot of optimisation (fixed-point, some pre-calculations, etc.) 
and I'm not including the 3d sprites engine.

This raycaster is based on the technique used in the book "Tricks of the game
programing gurus" 

Also, the keyboard handler used in the demo is the one that Jim Bucher 
uses on the isometric demo also for the chronicls project.

The demo program does not have colision detection so you can pass thru
walls, becarful, you can get out of the 2d map and it may work but it may not.
