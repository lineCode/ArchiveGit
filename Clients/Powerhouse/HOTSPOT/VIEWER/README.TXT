Wayne Radinsky, Microsoft Developer Relations, 4 October 1993

The hotspot code was written using Visual C/C++.  The makefile
is AVIHED.MAK and is backward compatible with previous versions
of microsoft C/C++, however it uses complete pathnames and you
may need to go in and edit the pathname to point to your build
directory in order to run nmake successfully.
