This small utility was written in Watcom C with WGT 5.0, and PMODE/W.
It converts from one image format to another, and supports
GIF, PCX, LBM, PAK, and RAW formats.

What makes this utility different is it allows you to create your
own raw format.  The raw format can be made up of 4 elements:

Width: 2 bytes
Height: 2 bytes
Palette: 768 bytes
Image data: width*height bytes

You can decide which ones to include and what order they appear in 
the file.  You can also read RAW files and change them into other 
formats.  If the width and height aren't stored in the raw format,
the program prompts you for them.

It is also useful for grabbing a palette out of an image.

The screen has each option numbered.  To cycle through the image formats
and elements, type the number repeatedly.
